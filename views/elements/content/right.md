# Manhattan Hydraulics is a digital product studio and emerging technologies R&D group. We're passionate about humane software that empowers individuals and organizations around the world to do better work, live happier lives, and think in new ways.

We value responsibility, transparency, egalitarianism, support, autonomy, and good vibes. We’re excited to contribute to innovations in personal computing, web3 and peer-to-peer technologies, social equity and justice, and sustainability.

## Design like water
We work adaptively to shape products as we learn more about a business and develop domain expertise. We embed our team with yours, forming a tight-knit, coordinated effort to steward an idea from hunch, to definition, to production.

## Shaping the product
A great product needs a strong strategic foundation. We’ll collaboratively “shape” the requirements, vision, and goals. Shaping exposes new opportunities, and builds trust, team alignment, and a plan of action driving toward release.

## Defining the mechanics
A great product is also, well, how the product works. We work “close to the metal,” using systems thinking to design for the needs, goals, incentives, and workflows of your users.

## Polishing the experience
In the end, your product not only needs great foundations and mechanics, but also style and interactivity. We’ll develop a strong creative vision that brings your brand’s voice to life through the product’s visual design and interactions.
