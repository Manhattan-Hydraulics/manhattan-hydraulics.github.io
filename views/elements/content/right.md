# Manhattan Hydraulics is a digital product studio and emerging technologies R&D group.

We value responsibility, transparency, egalitarianism, support, autonomy, and good vibes. We’re excited to contribute to innovations in personal computing, web3 and peer-to-peer technologies, social equity and justice, and sustainability.

## Design like water
We work adaptively to shape products as we learn more about a business and develop domain expertise. We embed our team with yours, forming a tight-knit, coordinated effort to steward an idea from hunch, to definition, to production.

## Shaping the product
A great product needs a strong strategic foundation. We’ll collaboratively “shape” the requirements, vision, and goals. Shaping exposes new opportunities, and builds trust, team alignment, and a plan of action driving toward release.

## Defining the mechanics
A great product is also, well, how the product works. We work “close to the metal,” using systems thinking to design for the needs, goals, incentives, and workflows of your users.

## Polishing the experience
In the end, your product not only needs great foundations and mechanics, but also style and interactivity. We’ll develop a strong creative vision that brings your brand’s voice to life through the product’s visual design and interactions.
